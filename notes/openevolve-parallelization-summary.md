# OpenEvolve Parallelization Summary

## Overview

You wanted to parallelize LLM calls in the OpenEvolve codebase to maximize throughput when using Modal for deployed LLM inference. We identified that the current evolution loop was sequential, creating a bottleneck.

## Architecture Development

We consulted the Oracle and developed a distributed architecture plan (`updated-distributed-modal-architecture-plan.md`) that leverages Modal's auto-scaling for both LLM inference and sandboxed evaluation. This plan involved refactoring the controller into a distributed system with a `ControllerHub` for state management, `evolve_worker` functions, and separate LLM and evaluation services.

## Implementation

We then implemented this distributed architecture in `openevolve/distributed_controller.py`, ensuring it had full feature parity with the original sequential controller and used the correct Modal APIs. We also added CLI support via the `--distributed` flag in `openevolve/cli.py` and created a test script (`test_distributed_controller.py`) to validate the implementation.

## Refinements

The implementation was refined based on Oracle's feedback, fixing issues related to Modal setup, serialization, method calls, iteration semantics, and overall correctness. The `llm_generate` function was corrected to use the existing Modal vLLM endpoint via HTTP, and the `evaluate_program` function was updated to correctly integrate with the `SandboxExecutor`. Iteration tracking was also fixed to maintain sequential generation semantics.

## Current Status

Currently, the `DistributedController` is implemented and has passed basic tests. The next steps would involve deploying this distributed controller to Modal and performing comprehensive performance testing and benchmarking.

## Key Files and Functions

### Core Implementation
- `openevolve/distributed_controller.py`: Contains the core distributed logic, including `DistributedController`, `ControllerHub`, `evolve_worker`, `llm_generate`, and `evaluate_program`.
- `openevolve/controller.py`: The original sequential controller, useful for understanding the baseline and desired semantics.
- `openevolve/cli.py`: Modified to include the `--distributed` flag for selecting the new controller.
- `test_distributed_controller.py`: A script for basic validation of the distributed controller's initialization and CLI integration.

### Critical Components
- `openevolve/distributed_controller.py` (specifically `ControllerHub` and `evolve_worker`): These are crucial for understanding how state is managed and how tasks are distributed.
- `llm_generate` function: Note its correction to use HTTP calls to the vLLM endpoint, not direct GPU allocation.
- `evaluate_program` function: Note its integration with the `SandboxExecutor` for proper sandboxed evaluation.
- `ControllerHub.get_next_iteration()`: This method is key to maintaining sequential iteration semantics in a parallel execution environment.
- `openevolve/distributed_controller.py` (producer loop): The logic for managing task spawning and buffer size is important for understanding throughput.
